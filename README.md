## Introduction

This repository contains a single-page interactive web application (SPA) designed to transform a technical report on building custom Linux kernel modules for WSL2 into an easily consumable and explorable experience. Acting as an interactive guide, this application simplifies the complex process of setting up the environment, developing, compiling, and deploying kernel modules within the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) environment.

The primary goal of this SPA is to enhance user understanding and ease of navigation, moving beyond a static document to provide a dynamic, task-oriented learning tool. It is particularly useful for developers and system administrators looking to extend WSL2's capabilities with custom kernel modules for specific functionalities not available in the standard WSL2 kernel.

## Features

* **Interactive Process Flowchart:** A visual, clickable flowchart that outlines the entire kernel module development and deployment process, allowing users to quickly jump to relevant sections.

* **Step-by-Step Guidance:** Content is organized into logical, thematic sections (Setup, Development, Deployment, Reference) accessible via a sticky side navigation bar, guiding the user through each phase.

* **Dynamic Code Blocks:** Code snippets for prerequisites, kernel source preparation, module code, and Makefile are presented in interactive blocks with one-click copy functionality, reducing manual errors.

* **Module Name Customization:** An input field allows users to dynamically update the module name, which automatically reflects in the generated C code, Makefile, and DKMS configuration snippets.

* **Deployment Comparison Chart:** A Chart.js bar chart visually compares the "Effort" and "Persistence" trade-offs between manual module deployment and DKMS integration, providing quick insights.

* **Tabbed Deployment Instructions:** Detailed steps for both manual module deployment and DKMS integration are presented in a tabbed interface, allowing users to switch between methods easily.

* **Accordion-style Troubleshooting:** A dedicated section for common issues and their solutions, presented in an expandable accordion format for quick access to relevant information without cluttering the interface.

* **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring optimal viewing and usability across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the core structure of the single-page application.

* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid and responsive UI development.

* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** Powers all interactive elements, dynamic content updates, navigation, and data handling.

* **Chart.js:** A JavaScript charting library used for creating the interactive deployment comparison bar chart.

## Information Architecture & User Experience

The application's structure is designed for intuitive exploration and task completion, rather than mirroring the original report's linear chapter format. The information architecture is based on a **thematic, task-oriented approach**:

* **Sticky Side Navigation:** Provides persistent access to major sections, allowing users to jump between "Setup," "Development," "Deployment," and "Reference" without losing context. This supports a non-linear learning path.

* **Process Flowchart:** Serves as a high-level visual roadmap, immediately orienting the user to the overall process and acting as a quick navigation tool.

* **Categorized Content:** Each main section groups related information and interactive elements (e.g., "Setup" contains prerequisites and kernel source preparation).

* **Interactive Elements for Clarity:**

  * **Code Blocks with Copy:** Directly supports the user's task of executing commands, minimizing friction.

  * **Dynamic Module Name:** Enhances personalization and reduces repetitive manual edits for the user.

  * **Comparison Chart:** Visually synthesizes complex information (manual vs. DKMS) into an easily digestible format, aiding decision-making.

  * **Tabs for Deployment:** Clearly separates two distinct deployment methods, preventing cognitive overload.

  * **Accordions for Troubleshooting:** Organizes detailed solutions efficiently, allowing users to find specific answers without scrolling through large blocks of text.

This structure was chosen to facilitate a clear user flow, from initial environment setup to module deployment and troubleshooting, making the complex topic of kernel module development more approachable and actionable.

## How to Use

To use this interactive guide:

1. **Clone the repository** (if hosted on GitHub) or download the `index.html` file.

2. **Open the `index.html` file** in your preferred web browser.

The application is self-contained within this single HTML file and does not require any server-side components.
